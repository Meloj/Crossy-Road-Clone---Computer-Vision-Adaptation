# Crossy-Road-Clone---Computer-Vision-Adaptation
The game I developed is a reimagining of the classic Crossy Road, and the difference is in the way the character is controlled. Instead of the traditional keyboard, movements are captured via the webcam, allowing players to control the game with hand gestures.
